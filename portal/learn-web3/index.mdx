## Introduction to Web3

### Welcome

Welcome! If you're new to web3, then you've come to the right place.

In this Intro to Web3 path, we'll help you:

1. Understand web3 concepts like tokens and blockchains (such as Ethereum or Polygon).
2. Set up your wallet, add cryptocurrency, and avoid scams.
3. Learn about other chains - Layer 1s, Layer 2s, & sidechains.
4. Dive into Web3 development concepts

To start, let’s compare Web1, Web2, and Web3

## Web1 vs Web2 vs Web3

As [Eshita writes succinctly](https://eshita.mirror.xyz/H5bNIXATsWUv_QbbEz6lckYcgAa2rhXEPDRkecOlCOI):

- Web1: Read
- Web2: Read, write
- Web3: Read, write, own

**Web1** (1990-early 2000s) was read-only. People consumed static webpages that they navigated to directories like Yahoo. Web1 was built on open-source protocols like HTTP.

**Web2** (early 2000s-today) is read and write. People create and consume content on the social platforms that we're all familiar with. In web2, tech giants extract value from users by sitting in the middle. Web2 is built on client-server architecture where users are the client, and companies control the servers.

**Web3** (2020+) is read, write, and own.  People create, consume, and own the upside of their work through **tokens**. Web3 is built on peer-to-peer networks of computers that talk to each other without middlemen.

## What are tokens?

**A token is a record of ownership of an asset.**

Tokens can be fungible or non-fungible:

- **Fungible tokens** are interchangeable (e.g., the US dollar, bitcoin).
- **Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** are unique (e.g., a piece of art).

Let’s look at a game like Fortnite or Roblox as an example:

- Fungible tokens are the virtual currency (e.g., VBucks, Robux).
- Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the character skins and emotes.

Tokens live on the blockchain.

## What is a blockchain?

**A blockchain is a linked list of transactions stored on a network of computers.**

Blockchains are:

1. **Decentralized**: Transactions are on a network of computers (nodes).
2. **Immutable**: Transactions cannot be changed once committed.
3. **Open**: Transactions can be viewed by anyone.

Blockchain is **a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system**. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.

## How does Ethereum work?

Ethereum is built on the blockchain and is decentralized, immutable, and open.

Ethereum's goal is to become the world's decentralized computer (called EVM or the Ethereum Virtual Machine). To understand what that even means, let’s define the following:

![Ethereum Definitions Infographic by Odyssey](/assets/portal/intro_to_thirdweb/ethereum_definitions.png)

_Ethereum definitions_

1. **Ether** or ETH is Ethereum’s digital token. Ether is a store of value like Bitcoin, but its main purpose is to reward nodes on the ethereum blockchain for processing transactions.
2. **Gas** is the amount of Ether that's paid to a node to process a transaction.
3. **Smart contracts** are code that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This code is decentralized (stored across all nodes in the network), immutable (can’t be changed once committed to the blockchain), and open (anyone can view the code and use it).
4. **Decentralized apps (dapp)** combine a backend smart contract with frontend UI.

Ethereum has the largest web3 developer ecosystem thanks to its **composability.** Like legos, anyone can build on an existing smart contract to create something new. This has led to the creation of [thousands of dapps](https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/#explore) that power web3 use cases such as:

1. Buying and selling NFTs ([OpenSea](https://opensea.io/))[‍](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?utm_source=StateOfTheDApps)
2. Swapping tokens ([Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?utm_source=StateOfTheDApps))
3. Lending and borrowing tokens ([Compound](https://compound.finance/))
4. Earning income from playing games ([Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/))

Due to Ethereum's popularity, it costs a lot in gas to process transactions.

**Gas** is the amount of crypto that's paid to nodes on the blockchain to process a transaction.

For Ethereum, gas is measured in **gwei** (1 gwei = 0.000000001 ether). Visit [What Is Ethereum?](https://www.odysseydao.com/articles/what-is-ethereum) if you need a recap on how Ethereum works.

How much gas you pay depends on:

1. **Network congestion:** Gas is higher if many people are trying to get their transactions in.
2. **Transaction type:** Gas is higher if your transaction is complex (e.g., minting an NFT vs. sending crypto to another wallet).

Ethereum is not the only blockchain with gas fees, it’s just the most expensive.

## All About Wallets

**A cryptocurrency wallet is software or hardware ‘container’ that lets you store your digital assets (typically cryptocurrency or NFTs) and send/receive transactions while connected to a particular blockchain (or chain for short).**

### How does a crypto wallet work?

A crypto wallet stores two keys:

- A **public key aka wallet address** links to an address that lets you make transactions.
- A **private key** proves that you own the assets with your address.
- A **seed phrase** is 12-24 words that lets you access your private key.

![Crypto Wallet Artifacts Infographic by Odyssey](/assets/portal/intro_to_thirdweb/crypto_wallet_artifacts.png)

_A crypto wallet has a public key, private key, and seed phrase_

If your wallet was your bank account, your public key would be your account number and your private key would be your pin number. Of course, in web3, your assets are on the blockchain vs. in a bank. Just remember that:

1. **You can share your public key** with others \*\*\*\*to make transactions.
2. **You must never share your private key or seed phrase** with anyone.

## Which wallet to get?

![Types of Crypto Wallets Infographic by Odyssey](/assets/portal/intro_to_thirdweb/types_of_crypto_wallets.png)

Crypto wallets can be hot (software) or cold (hardware).

### Hot wallets

Hot wallets are connected to the internet. They’re more convenient but less secure than cold wallets. There are two types of hot wallets:

- **Custodial wallets** are managed by an exchange (e.g., Coinbase) that you log in to with a username and password. With a hosted wallet, you don’t own your keys. In fact, most people use exchanges without realizing that they have a wallet.
- **Non-custodial wallets** are self-managed. Because you own your keys, you can use these wallets as your web3 identity. Popular non-custodial wallets include [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/), and [Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/).

### Cold wallets

Cold wallets are hardware devices that are naturally more secure because they are offline by default.

- **Custodial wallets** are managed by an exchange (e.g., Coinbase) that you log in to with a username and password. With a hosted wallet, you don’t own your keys. In fact, most people use exchanges without realizing that they have a wallet.

In a hot wallet like Metamask, your seed phrase is stored on your internet-connected computer. Unfortunately, that means that it’s liable to get hacked or phished.

In a cold wallet like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) and [Trezor](https://trezor.io/), your seed phrase is stored in a separate hardware device that’s default offline and much harder to hack.

### Tips to secure wallet

Here’s how you can secure your wallet:

1. **Store your private key and seed phrase in a secure location.** Mine is written on physical paper that I keep with other important documents offline.
2. **Never share your private key or seed phrase with anyone.** It doesn’t matter who asks - just don’t share it.
3. **Secure your wallet password.** If your wallet has a separate password, anyone who has it can get your private key. Choose a secure password and turn on 2FA.
4. **Move long-term assets out of your daily hot wallet.** Put them into a cold wallet or another hot wallet. If you have a lot of assets in your wallet and share its address publicly, you’re asking to get scammed.
5. **Don’t click random links!** **Check the website URL, email, or social handle before taking any action.** Scammers will pretend to be a trusted platform to phish for your seed phrase.
6. **Turn off Discord DMs and don’t interact with unknown assets in your wallet.** These are two common attack vectors that scammers use.

## Layer 1s and Layer 2s

### What are Layer 1s and Layer 2s?

Let’s start with a few definitions:

1. **Layer 1 chain** is the main Ethereum blockchain. Other non-ETH L1 chains include [Solana](https://solana.com/), [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/), and [Terra](https://www.terra.money/).
2. **Layer 2 chain** process transactions off-chain before bundling and submitting them to Ethereum L1. Examples include [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/), [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), and [Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/).
3. **Sidechains** are separate blockchains with their own gas token. [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) is the most popular sidechain.

L2 chains and sidechains offer **faster and cheaper transactions** than Ethereum L1. We highly recommend using these chains to do transactions.
