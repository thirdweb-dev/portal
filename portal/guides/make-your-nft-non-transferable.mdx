## Dashboard setup

The first thing we need to do is head over to the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) and create a project and a **NFT Collection**, **Bundle**, **Drop** or **Bundle Drop** module, you can make your NFT non-transferable in any of these. If you don't know how to create a project, check out [this guide](/learn/introduction).

## Create the module

For my example, I'll create bundle drop module! A **Cookie Access NFT!**.

Then I'll create the access NFT, a **Chocolate Cookie**.

## Make it non-transferable

Once we create it, click on **Settings**.

Then, we can scroll down and we'll find "Transfer Settings", here is where we can switch our NFT to be non-transferable.

Click **Save** and accept the transaction on your wallet.

## Permissions

Once this has been set, only people with the **Transfer** role would be able to transfer, by default, it's only set to the wallet that created the NFT.

You can go to the **Permissions** tab and remove yourself, also, if you don't want to be able to add a **Transfer** role to anyone in the future, you can also remove yourself from the **Admin** role.

## That's it!

Now your NFT can't be transferred or sold anymore, one thing to note is that people can still list it on platforms like OpenSea, but if someone tries to buy it, the transaction will fail.
