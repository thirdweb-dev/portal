By default, NFTs are transferrable. We can sell them on secondary markets or transfer them to other users. There are also times when we want the NFT to be non-transferable. For example, maybe we want to reward our community with some exclusive award NFT to those who completed a challenge, or maybe for issuing NFT certificates.

💡 Another common name for non-transferrable NFTs are soulbound NFTs. Learn more about them and their use cases from Vitalik Buterin’s post titled [Soulbound](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html).

In this guide, we will learn how to make it so users can't transfer or sell our NFTs. This process can all be done without writing any code. 

Let’s get started!

### Setup

Navigate to the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard), and create a new contract: choose from either an **NFT Collection, Edition, NFT Drop,** or **Edition Drop**. You can make your NFT non-transferable in any of these versions.

For this guide, we will create an **NFT Collection** contract.

Fill out the general settings to distinguish your contracts and payout settings. After that, scroll down and click the blue bar at the bottom that says **Deploy Now**.

Next, click the blue **Mint +** button on the top right. This will pull up a side panel that will allow us to create our NFT. After filling in the fields, click **+ Mint NFT** to finish the minting process.

### Make it non-transferable

Once created, you should see your newly minted NFT on your dashboard. Click on the **permissions** tab.

From the permissions tab, scroll down to the **Transfer** permissions. Click the drop down that says **Transferrable** and change it to **Non-Transferrable.**

After updating, click on **update permissions**. This will prompt a transaction you need to confirm from your wallet.

### Permissions

Once updated, only addresses with the **Transfer** role are able to transfer the NFT. By default, this is set to the wallet that created the NFT.

💡 Having an **Admin** role allows you to change the rules of the contract in the future. If you don't want to be able to add a **Transfer** role to anyone in the future, remove yourself from the **Admin** role.

If you don’t want to be able to transfer the NFT, remove yourself from the **transfer** permissions and update permissions again.

💡 **Note:** users can still list non-transferrable NFTs on marketplaces like OpenSea. However, if someone tries to purchase it, the transaction will fail.

### That’s it!

Now, your NFT is non-transferrable.
