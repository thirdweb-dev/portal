## Intro

In this guide we’ll create multiple NFT Drop’s with the `NFT Drop` module, but we won't reveal the NFTs immediately. Instead we’ll set up some conditions to reveal the NFTs. So you mint your NFTs now, but reveal them when you want to. Let’s go👇

## Disclaimer

In order to use this feature you need to make sure your `NFT Drop` module is deployed after 12th of February. Older versions of this module do not support this feature. If you try this in an older version, you’ll see a warning in the dashboard.

Also if you’re looking for an in-depth guide on how to release a big NFT drop with no-code, check out [this](/guides/release-an-nft-drop-with-no-code#thats-it) guide. If you want to know how to create a `NFT Drop` module, check out that guide or [this](/learn/modules) page.

Make sure you have a module set up, before you continue.

## Create the bulk upload

Go ahead and click on `Batch Upload` inside your module.

You should see the following screen, which asks you for a csv file and the assets (images for example). The csv file and images must be in the same folder. Below I dragged to folder to the upload area. If you’re looking for a quick example, check out [this](https://github.com/nachoiacovino/thirdweb-pokemon) Github. It’s the one I’m using in the example below.

Click next when you’re done.

## Configuring the delay feature

Pick the option you prefer. In this guide we will go for `Delayed Reveal`.

You will be prompted to fill in the following information. The `password` and `name` are mandatory. Make sure you remember the `password` well! You need this to `reveal` your NFTs later on. Click on `Upload NFT` when you’re done.

Once you’re inside your dashboard you should see all your NFTs there, but the image is hidden. To reveal your NFTs, go ahead and click on `Reveal NFTs`.

## Reveal the NFT Drop

You will be prompted for the password you created in the previous step. Note, revealing the NFTs will reveal all NFTs and you will need to pay for gas fees. Once the dashboard is done you should see your NFTs 👇
