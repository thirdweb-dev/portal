## Developers assemble!

In a nutshell, our SDK integrates seamlessly on the frontend or backend, depending on your use case. We've written an article over [here](/guides/sdk-guide), where we go more in dept.

This is what we're going to cover here:

1. Your design based on your use case
2. Set up your dev environment
3. Using the SDK

## Dependencies

First make sure you install the dependencies.

If you're using JavaScript or TypeScript 👇

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers
```

And if you're using React 👇

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers
```

## Your use case

Before we get to the fun part of coding, let's talk about design. Depending on your use case, you'd want to use our sdk in a specific way. To cater for your web3 needs, we built smart contracts on steroids. Our contracts enable the feature you want inside your app.
For example, if you want a `mint` functionality in your app, then you'd need the `NFT Collection` contract. Maybe you want to reward users with your own tokens when they complete a specific action, then you want to have a look at our `Token` contract. Auction your NFTs on your own Marketplace? We got you → the `Marketplace` contract is what you need.

![Overview of our contracts](/assets/portal/contracts/index/select-type-of-contract.png)

Based on your needs you can pick contracts, which contain the functionalities and features that you want in your app.

Next up, setting up your dev environment.

## Using our SDK - Setting up your dev environment

Ok, so you know what you want to build. You deployed the contracts you need through the dashboard. Now it's time to integrate them into your own code!

General steps:

1. Instantiate the SDK
2. Pass the contract address
3. Use the methods inside a contract

### 1. Read data from the blockchain

If you _just_ want to read data from the blockchain, all you need is our `@thirdweb-dev/sdk`.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

// This url indicates which chain you want to connect to
const rpcUrl = "https://polygon-rpc.com/";

const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(rpcUrl);
```

Side note, this is a public **RPC**. If you have your own dedicated **RPC** Alchemy or Infura**,** you can use that one instead.

Reading data from the blockchain with our sdk looks like this 👇

```jsx
// Initialize marketplace contract by passing in the contract address
const marketplaceAddress = "<MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS>";
const marketplace = sdk.getMarketplace(marketplaceAddress);

// Get all the listings
const getAllListings = async () => {
  try {
    await marketplace.getAllListings();
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}
getAllListings();
```

### 2. Make things happen on the blockchain

When you buy an NFT or make anything happen on the blockchain, you're doing more than reading data from the blockchain. Every action that changes the data stored on the blockchain — like buying an NFT — is signed off by a wallet.

A provider is your connection to the blockchain.

To read data from the blockchain, a `provider` needs an RPC url. To _write_ data to the blockchain i.e. send a transaction to the blockchain, — it needs to be able to interface with a wallet.

The **`Signer`** object is a clean interface to interact with a wallet.

Once you have a provider, you can use it to instantiate the SDK to write to the blockchain on behalf of a connected user.

```tsx
// Follow our guides to get a signer (from a connected wallet or your private key)
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(signer);

// Get your marketplace contract
const marketplaceAddress = "0xC06adC34097afa2085324D4192fbE9206059f8e0";
const marketplace = sdk.getMarketplace(marketplaceAddress);

// Now you can buy from the connected signer
const buyoutListing = async (listingId, quantityDesired) => {
  try {
    await marketplace.direct.buyoutListing(listingId, quantityDesired);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}
buyoutListing(listingId, quantityDesired);
```

How do you get a `signer` ? Glad you asked.

To get a signer we need to connect the user's wallet to our app. Let's build a `connect wallet` button. thirdweb has a component for this 👇

Check out [this](/guides/add-connectwallet-to-your-website) guide first to understand how the `connect wallet` component works for frontend and [this](/guides/sdk-guide#code-to-instantiate-the-sdk-at-the-client-side-frontend) guide is highly encouraged to read, to understand how the wallet information is used to instantiate the sdk and methods.

Information like chain and type of wallet, will be used to instantiate the sdk, by getting the `provider` from `useWeb3()`.

With the sdk you can access your deployed contracts to mint NFTs, transfer tokens or list NFTs on your marketplace.

### 3. Writing scripts

**Warning:** This method is **not** suitable for frontend.

The final way to initialise the sdk is to make use of your own wallet's `private keys`.

This method should be used with extreme care on the backend, making sure not to expose your private keys. If you want to know more about this method, check out [this](/guides/sdk-guide#backend) guide.
