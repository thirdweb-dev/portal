## Intro

Connecting and interacting with a blockchain from the frontend works slightly different than you might be used too. In this guide we will dive deeper into what type of connection you need to perform certain interactions with a blockchain.

## Provider

The provider is an easy way to connect to a block chain. When you _just_ want to **read** data from the blockchain, the provider is the best way to connect your app to the blockchain.

Regardless of using thirdweb's sdk or another sdk, you will need a provider to establish this connection.

So a provider is a simple connection and this is what the connection looks like in terms of code:

```jsx
import { ethers } from ethers
const rpcUrl = "https://polygon-rpc.com/";
const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider(rpcUrl);
```

A `provider` contains the information to tell our sdk which blockchain you want to use. A **RPC** url is the information the `provider` needs to decide which blockchain to retrieve data from.

**RPC** is a simple form of API interaction and stands for **Remote Procedure Call.** In other words we will use this url to make an API call to the chain.

### Using a read only provider with thirdweb

The thirdwebs sdk can be used to interact with your modules. To use our sdk to read data from the blockchain we need to create a connection with a `provider`. Then we tell it which blockchain to target via the **RPC** url.

Make sure you have the packages installed. `npm install @3rdweb/sdk` for JavaScript or TypeScript and `pip install thirdweb-sdk` for Python.

```jsx
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@3rdweb/sdk";

// This url indicates which chain you want to connect to
const rpcUrl = "https://polygon-rpc.com/";
const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider(rpcUrl);
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(provider);
```

Here's an example of how to use the provider in an use case where you _just_ want to retrieve data, like getting the number of NFTs you've minted so far. \*\*

```jsx
// Initialize nft module by passing in the module address
const nftModuleAddress = "0xD9bC403529471515F16DA32eee652c0a6cEcBA78";
const nft = sdk.getNFTModule(nftModuleAddress);
nft.balance();
```

You can find the addresses of your modules inside your dashboard.

By now you should have some modules deployed. If you haven't, check out [this](/learn/projects) page to create and deploy a module. If you don't know what modules are, click [here](/learn/introduction)!

Here's another example, to get all the listings in our market we use the `getAllListings` method.

```jsx
// Initialize market module by passing in the module address
const marketplaceModuleAddress = "0xC06adC34097afa2085324D4192fbE9206059f8e0";
const marketplace = sdk.getMarketplaceModule(marketModuleAddress);

// Get all the listings
marketplace.getAllListings();
```

## Signer

The `Signer` represents a connection established with a wallet. This connection has access to methods, which prompts the wallet to authorise and **sign** transactions, such as minting an NFT or transferring tokens.

If you want to mint NFTs or claim tokens, then you want to **write** data on the blockchain. In order to do this we need to enrich the `Provider` with a `Signer`. We explained in the previous step why we need the `Provider`.

The `Provider` doesn't hold any interface or connection to a wallet, it can only read from the blockchain and thus requires less security and care.

The `Signer` is necessary to authorize transactions. When you mint an NFT or claim a token, you perform a transaction on the blockchain. Every transaction **needs** to be authorized by the user. To authorize a transaction, the user needs to sign the transaction with their wallet. The `Signer` has access to methods that can prompt the connected wallet to authorize the relevant transaction

You might have seen this process while using your wallet on any web3 app. You want to buy an NFT or claim a token and then your wallet pops up in your browser to confirm the transaction.

### Connect your users wallet with thirdweb

A wallet contains sensitive information and you do **not** want this data accessible by anyone except for the owner! At thirdweb we take security extremely seriously. That's why we developed a connect wallet flow for your users to sign transactions, without their sensitive data being exposed, by obtaining a `Signer`.

The user does not need to worry that we can see their private keys. That is not possible. Every transaction still needs to be approved by the user. The `Signer` just allows our sdk to handle the heavy lifting once the user authorizes the transaction from the frontend.

thirdweb has a component to get the necessary information from the wallet to provide context to the `Provider` , specifically the `Signer` and we then use that provider to instantiate an sdk that can perform **write** methods.

### Connect your wallet

thirdweb has created custom hooks for most wallets, that provides you the functionality for a `connect wallet` button. 
You can use this functionality inside a button. Here's an example of what the code looks like:

```jsx
import { useMetamask } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export const ConnectMetamaskButtonComponent = () => {
  // get a function to connect to a particular wallet
  // options: useMetamask() - useCoinbase() - useWalletConnect()
  const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();
  // once connected, you can get the connected wallet information from anywhere (address, signer)
  const address = useAddress();
  return (
    <div>
      (
        <button onClick={connectWithMetamask}>Connect Metamask Wallet</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```
For each wallet we have a dedicated hook. Head over to our [documentation](https://docs.thirdweb.com/react) to check which wallets we support.

### Interacting with your contract

Once you've connected your wallet, your application can access the `Signer` to authorise transactions. thirdweb developed custom hooks for each of our contracts. 
This means you don't have to pass the `Signer` manually. We even instantiate the sdk for you! 
To make use of this:
1. import the hook from `@thirdweb-dev/react`
2. pass your contract address
After that you can make use of the methods in our sdk, this is how it looks:

```jsx
import { useNFTCollection } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const NFTListComponent = () => {
  // get an instance of your own contract
  const nftCollection = useNFTCollection("{{your nft contract address}}");
  const [nfts, setNfts] = useState<NFTMetadataOwner[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (nftCollection) {
      // call functions on your contract
      nftCollection
        .getAll()
        .then((nfts) => {
          setNfts(nfts);
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          console.error("failed to fetch nfts", error);
        });
    }
  }, [nftCollection]);
  return (
    <ul>
      {nfts.map((nft) => (
        <li key={nft.metadata.id.toString()}>{nft.metadata.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
```
After you've imported the hook and passed your contract address, you have access to all our methods, read and write, to interact with your contract.
Head over to our [documentation](https://docs.thirdweb.com/react) to check out all our hooks.


### Interact with your contract

Click [here](/guides/add-connectwallet-to-your-website) for a guide on how to obtain a `Signer` by including a `Connect Wallet` button in your app.

Check out [this](/guides/token-button-react) guide or [this](/guides/claim-button-react) guide to see examples of using `Signer` with the thirdweb sdk.

### Using your own signer with thirdweb

**warning: this method is not suitable for frontend**

There are cases where you might want to run a script or integrate our sdk on the backend. In this case the `Connect Wallet` frontend component cannot be used.

Another way to connect to the blockchain in this case, is by passing the `Private Key` of your wallet directly, when instantiating the sdk. To understand more about **how** to do this properly (i.e. making sure your `Private Key` is not exposed), check out [this](/guides/sdk-guide) guide.

When opting for this method to establish a connection to the blockchain, you will need to explicitly pass the RPC url too, to tell the sdk which chain you want to connect.

Here's an example of doing this in TypeScript👇

```jsx
// Instantiate thirdrdweb SDK
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(
    new ethers.Wallet(
        // Your wallet private key
        process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string,
        // RPC URL
        ethers.getDefaultProvider("https://rinkeby-light.eth.linkpool.io/")
    )
);
```

And here is one in Python 👇

```python
# choose your network
network = "https://rinkeby-light.eth.linkpool.io/"
# create the object
sdk = ThirdwebSdk(SdkOptions(), network)
# use the '.env' file inside Python
loadenv("./.env")
PRIVATE_KEY = os.getenv('PRIVATE_KEY')
# over here we connect our wallet via the private key stored in the '.env' file
sdk.set_private_key(PRIVATE_KEY)
```
