## In a nutshell

![Dashboard option](/assets/portal/learn/drop/dashboard.png)

thirdweb’s `Drop` module lazy mints an NFT and makes it available to be claimed by your users. Lazy minting is when the creator defines conditions for a third party (your audience) to come in and mint the NFT. You choose what the underlying token is you want to distribute. So it can be a 1 of 1 NFT or 1 of many. Our `Drop` module gives you the mechanism to distribute that token.

## How it works

Make sure you choose the right module. If you want your **drop** to include 1 of 1 NFTs, choose the `NFT Drop` module. If you want to mint 1 of many NFTs, choose the `Bundle Drop` module.

To be clear, when you create a drop inside your `Drop` module, the NFT is not minted yet. We prepare everything for your audience, so that they can mint it. The user who claims an NFT, mints it and transfers it to their wallet. By default the user pays the gas fees.

You can create a drop via the dashboard or our SDK. Once you’ve created a drop with the `Drop` module, the NFT does not show up in your wallet, but in a null address. The NFT is now ready to be claimed.

The claim conditions determine the rules for claiming an NFT over a period of time. The claim conditions have a different scope depending on the underlying contract. If you use an `NFT Drop` module, then the claim conditions you set, apply to every NFT (token ID) in that module.

If you use the `Bundle Drop` module, you can set claim conditions **per NFT** (token ID).

### Claim Conditions

You can set the condition in both the dashboard, inside your `Drop` module or via code. Some of the conditions you can set:

1. The currency, meaning what the NFT should be payed in, if there’s a price to mint.
2. Price per NFT
3. The max number of NFTs that are available to be claimed. It’s possible you minted more, than you want people to claim.
4. The wait time between claims
5. Claims per transaction decides how many NFTs you can claim per transaction
6. Snapshot will allow you to include a list of `Allow-list` wallet addresses

## What can you do with our module?

The following use cases are suited for the `NFT DROP` module and are driven

1. Setup early access NFT (click here for a guide on that)
2. List an NFT for sale on a Marketplace (you would also need the `Marketplace` module for this)

### Our Embed feature

thirdweb developed an UI component for your app. All you need to do is include one html line for this. You can find this 👇 feature inside the dashboard under the tab `Embed` .

### NFT delayed reveal feature
This feature lets you batch upload in an NFT Drop and hide your NFTs until your release day.
If you want to make use of this feature, these are the steps to follow:
- Do a batch upload
- Select Delayed Reveal
- Choose a password (save it, you'll need it to reveal your NFTs later!)
- Choose an image, name and description for the placeholder NFT
- Upload!
Then, when you want to reveal your NFTs, just go back to your dashboard, click the "Reveal NFTs" button and write the password that you submitted previously.

## How to use the module

You can use the `NFT Drop` module with or without code:

1. TypeScript
2. Python
3. Dashboard Embed (our no-code solution)

### Setup your dev environment

To interact with your NFT Drop module with code, you need to follow 3 steps:

1. Install the necessary packages on your (local) machine
2. Instantiate the SDK
3. Passing the address of the Module inside your code

To install the necessary packages for TypeScript or Python on your (local) machine and instantiate the SDK in your code, check out [this](https://portal.thirdweb.com/learn/connect-to-blockchain) guide to help you with that. Note, you can instantiate the SDK in multiple ways, so make sure to check out that guide.

You can find the module address in the thirdweb dashboard, inside your project or inside the `NFT Drop` module itself.

### Usage Examples

After you instantiate the sdk, you can use the `Drop` module with our sdk. Here’s how to get the module inside your code using typescript and claim one token.

```jsx
const drop = sdk.getDropModule("0x7aB28C145FF201e0b6C96C8Adea78dA44B551d72");
quantity = 1;
drop.claim(quantity);
```

Here’s an example of setting the claim conditions with code

```jsx
// Initialize the NFT drop module with the contract address.
const drop = sdk.getDropModule(dropAddress);

const setTokenClaimConditions = async () => {
  const factory = await drop.getClaimConditionsFactory();

  // Define claim phase.
  const claimPhase = await factory.newClaimPhase({
    startTime: new Date(),
    maxQuantity: 10,
    maxQuantityPerTransaction: 1,
  });

  // Set price.
  claimPhase.setPrice(1);

  // Set wait time between claims.
  claimPhase.setWaitTimeBetweenClaims(24 * 60 * 60);

  // Allow snapshot for the specified list.
  const allowList = [
    "[ALLOWED_ADDRESS_1]",
    "[ALLOWED_ADDRESS_2]",
    "[ALLOWED_ADDRESS_3]",
    "[ALLOWED_ADDRESS_4]",
  ];

  claimPhase.setSnapshot(allowList);

  // Set claim conditions.
  await drop.setClaimConditions(factory);
};
```
