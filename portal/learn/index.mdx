## Intro to our developer resources

- [TypeScript SDK](https://nftlabs.github.io/nftlabs-sdk-ts/sdk.html)
- [Python SDK](https://python-docs.thirdweb.com/)
- [Go SDK](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nftlabs/nftlabs-sdk-go/pkg/nftlabs)

## Getting Started

In this guide you'll be deploying your own custom token ERC20 smart contract and using the typescript SDK to interact with that smart contract and mint the token.

### Connect your wallet to Dashboard

You'll need a wallet that is connected to the **Polygon Mumbai Testnet**. We'll use **MetaMask** for this guide, if you don't have a **MetaMask** wallet, you can create one by following [this guide](/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet).

- Head over to the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/start).
- Click "**Let's get started**".
- Connect your wallet.
- Select your network (**Mumbai**).

### Create your first project

To create our project, we'll need **MATIC** on testnet, if you don't have any, you can follow [this guide](/guides/get-matic-on-polygon-mumbai-testnet-faucet) to get some.

- Head over to the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).
- Give your project a name (required)
- Give your project a description.
- Click "**Create**".
- Accept the transaction on your wallet.

### Create your first module

- Select your project.
- Click "**Add Module**".
- Select the **Token** module.
- Give it a **Name** and a **Symbol**, we'll use _Test Coin_ and _TEST_.
- Accept the two transactions on your wallet.

### View your smart contract on the blockchain

The token module that was created deployed a smart contract to the Mumbai blockchain.  To see the actual transaction:

- Inside the _Test Coin_ token module you will see an address under the name.  Copy this address
- Go to the [Mumbai Polygon Scan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/) and paste the token module address

You will see your smart contract and under transactions you will see the contract creation transaction.

### Adding permissions to your smart contract

In this section, we'll be giving minting permissions to a second wallet

- Head over to the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard), select your project and select the Token module we just created.
- Select the "**Permissions**" tab.
- On the "**Minter**" section, click "**Add Wallet**"
- Paste the public address of a second wallet (We'll call it _Wallet B_) in the input field.
- Click "**Save**"
- Accept the transaction on your wallet.

You'll see that now there's two wallets with "**Minter**" permissions.

Next up, we'll create a project and install the **TypeScript SDK** so we can mint our tokens programmatically from our _Wallet B_.

We're gonna be using thirdweb's **TypeScript SDK**, we'll be minting tokens from the wallet we just gave permissions to.

<br />

### Set up local environment

Everything we're gonna do from now on it's gonna be on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nftlabs/examples/tree/main/typescript/token-minter), so feel free to take a look at the finished product there.

Let's first create a folder and a TypeScript file, you can create these manually or do it from the terminal.

```bash
mkdir token-minter
cd token-minter
touch minter.ts
```

### Install required dependencies

Next we'll initialize the project and install the required dependencies:

- **@3rdweb/sdk** - thirdweb TypeScript SDK.
- **ethers** - will give us very useful utils.
- **dotenv** - to hide our private key.
- **typescript** - since this is a TypeScript project
- **@types/node** - typing for node as a dev dependency.
- **tslib** - utility package

```bash
npm init -y
npm install @3rdweb/sdk ethers dotenv
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node ts-node tslib
```


### Import the SDK

```ts
// Importing libraries
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@3rdweb/sdk";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

//Importing private key
require('dotenv').config();
```

We also need to create a .env file with our `PRIVATE_KEY`, you can check how to get your wallet's private key, on [this guide](/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet#export-your-private-key).

Remember that we're gonna mint from _Wallet B_, so you'll need the `PRIVATE_KEY` of that one.

Don't commit this `PRIVATE_KEY` to GitHub or anywhere else, don't use it on Repl.it, you will lose your funds, we recommend to use a Dev wallet instead of your real wallet.
<br />

```python:.env
PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key-here>
```

You should create a `.gitignore` file and add this line before commiting to GitHub.

```python:.gitignore
node_modules
.env
```

### Instantiate the SDK

```ts
//Instantiate 3rdweb SDK
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(
  new ethers.Wallet(
    // Your wallet private key
    process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string,
    // RPC URL, we'll use Polygon Mumbai
    ethers.getDefaultProvider("https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com")
  )
);
```

### Define what module to use

We're gonna be interacting with the **Token** module we created before on the dashboard, so we need to get the address of that module.

- Head over to the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).
- Navigate over to our **Token** module.
- Copy the address.

Now, let's instantiate the **Token** module

```ts
const token = sdk.getTokenModule("0xFf5f08cA7c5b0287A349517fa4B4243BB13229b9");
```

### Let's mint some tokens!

Let's now write some code to mint tokens, the interesting thing is we're minting them from _Wallet B_, which is not the wallet that created the contract, but the one that has **Minter** permissions.

We'll put it inside a try/catch block to make sure it works and return an error if it doesn't.

```ts
// Set the amount of currency you want to mint
// (Actual amount, number of decimals)
const amount = ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000", 18);

// Minting the currency, 1000 Test coin
const mintCurrency = async () => {
  try {
    await token.mint(amount);
    console.log("Minted 1000 Test coin");
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
};

// Running the entire thing
mintCurrency();
```

So the only thing left is run our code! Open a terminal and paste the following:

```bash
npx ts-node minter.ts
```

You will see a successful `console.log`, let's go and see our dashboard now!

And it's there, 1000 $TEST coins!

## That's it!

Congratulations! You've deployed smart contracts to the blockchain and integrated it with a mini web3 application. 

Do you realize how powerful that is?

The code for everything we've done in this project is in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nftlabs/examples/tree/main/typescript/token-minter).

And this only scratching the surface on what thirdweb can do.  Check out our guides on some of the most common web3 workflows:
