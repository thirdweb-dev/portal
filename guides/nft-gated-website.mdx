## Setup NFT

1. Go to [https://thirdweb.com/dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard), connect your wallet and select the network you want to deploy to.
2. Create new project (if you don't have one).
3. Add a module: _Bundle (ERC 1155)_.
4. Add a name and description for your collection. (This will be displayed when users view the collection page on Opensea).
5. Click Deploy → confirm both steps in your wallet.
6. Click **Mint** on the top right corner to start minting your Membership NFT.
7. Add a name and description for your individual NFT. (This will be displayed when users view the individual NFT page on OpenSea).
8. You can mint multiple NFT's which represent different tiers of membership.
9. Your NFTs have now been minted, and after a few minutes will appear on Opensea under your collection.

**[0x4465...65EB]** is your NFT contract address.

## Let's write some code

We're going to setup a **private** section of our website for our **NFT holders**. In this guide, we'll be using **React** and the Javascript SDK.

### 1. Install the SDK in your web project

```bash
npm install @3rdweb/sdk ethers
```

### 2. Install React web3 libraries for Metamask Wallet Connect

```bash
// A few different options, pick one that works for you!
// In this guide, we'll be using @web3-react/core.
// Alternative options: @usedapp/core (<https://usedapp.io>), bnc-onboard (<https://docs.blocknative.com/onboard>), and more.

// source: <https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react>
npm install @web3-react/core @web3-react/injected-connector
```

### 3. Set up @web3-react in your project.

In the **entry point** of your React page. In Next.js, it would be `pages/_app.js`. In React, it would be in your `app.js`.

```jsx
import { Web3ReactProvider } from "@web3-react/core";

function getLibrary(provider) {
  return new Web3Provider(provider, "any");
}

export default function ({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <Web3ReactProvider getLibrary={getLibrary}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Web3ReactProvider>
  );
}
```

### 4. Gate access

In your React component, you can gate access based off the balance of the NFT in the connected wallet.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@3rdweb/sdk";
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { useWeb3React } from "@web3-react/core";

// Get the Membership NFT info from your dashboard. (thirdweb.com/dashboard)
const MEMBERSHIP_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS =
  "0x4465aE876e5263cB4Eaf42948723E28bB30C65E8";
const MEMBERSHIP_NFT_TOKEN_ID = "0";

const useWalletMembershipAccess = () => {
  // react states for chechking if user can access or not
  const [access, setAccess] = useState(false);
  const { account, library } = useWeb3React();

  async function checkWalletMembership() {
    // Get the connected wallet Signer
    const signer = library.getSigner(account);

    /* 
    Our SDK takes in a valid Signer or Provider. 
    A signer can perform READ and WRITE calls on the blockchain.
    A provider can only perform READ calls on the blockchain.	  
    read more: <https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer>
    */
    const module = new ThirdwebSDK(signer).getCollectionModule(
      MEMBERSHIP_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    );
    const balance = await module.balance(MEMBERSHIP_NFT_TOKEN_ID);
    return balance.toNumber() >= 1;
  }

  // check wallet when account is connected
  if (library && account) {
    checkWalletMembership().then(setAccess);
  } else if (access) {
    // reset the state if wallet is disconnected
    setAccess(false);
  }

  return access;
};
```

### 5. Render your content conditionally

Use the `useWalletMembershipAccess` to render your content conditionally in your React components! An example:

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const hasMembershipAccess = useWalletMembershipAccess();
  return hasMembershipAccess ? <Text>Render Member Only Content</Text> : null;
};
```
