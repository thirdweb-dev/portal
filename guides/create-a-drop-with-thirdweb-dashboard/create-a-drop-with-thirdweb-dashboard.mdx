## Intro

In this guide we'll create our own **drop** with the dashboard! In a **drop** you can list your NFTs and make them available to be claimed. After we create our **drop**, we will claim the NFT we minted.

By the way we also need to connect a wallet. So if you don't have a wallet, make sure to sign up with MetaMask or CoinWallet. If don't have a wallet, [you can follow this guide to create one](/portal/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet).

Alright without further ado, let's create our **drop**!

## Dashboard setup

The first thing we need to do is head over to the [dashboard](/dashboard) and create a project and a **Drop** module. if you don't know how to do this, check out [this guide](/portal/learn/introduction).

### Set claim conditions

Once your **Drop** module has been created, we can go ahead and set the **Claim conditions**. These conditions are some of the rules we'll apply when someone wants to claim an NFT, such as price, max amount of tokens to be claimed, etc. Click on **Setup your claim condition**.

![Claim conditions](./claim_conditions.png)

In this example we will first pick our currency. To choose the native currency of a chain, leave the default setting, i.e. the 0x000...000.  We set the max price per nft as **0.01** ETH and the max supply 5. Click on **add** to finalise. Your wallet will pop-up to authorise a transaction.

Go ahead to settings to check your claim conditions. You can see them here. Please note, that if you change your claim conditions, you will have to pay gas fees. 

![Fill in module settings](./setup.png)

Over here you can also see the max supply you can set for your Drop. Please note the difference. You can create more drops than claims. In this case you would not want every piece of NFT to be claimed (yet). In this guide we will set the max to 5. Changing the amount of total supply in your settings, requires you to pay gas fees.

### Mint an NFT

![](./setup2.png)

Now it's time to create our first NFT for our drop module. Click on **Create**.

![Start minting an NFT](./start_drop.png)

Fill in the details for your NFT, such as name and description and upload a file. We're choosing an image in this example. After you're done click on **create drop**. Your wallet will pop up to authorise a transaction.

### Claim NFT

Once you minted the NFT, it's available to be claimed. We can even claim it ourself! To see how this works click on the **Claim Next Available**.

![Drop is created](./drop_created.png)

Once you clicked on the **Claim Next available** you will be prompted for a transaction. To claim your token, confirm the transaction.

## That's it!

Congratulations! You have created your first drop and claimed it!
